# Predicting_Diseases_Streamlit_ML
Using Machine Learning algorithms, the goal is to predict is to analyse and be able to predict if a patient is or is not in good health.

The structure of the directory is as followed:

- Firstly, you have two main parts, one about the report and the other one on the coding part

- To be able to run the code you have to:
	. be on the Project-Final-Year/Code_Submission. 
	. When you are on it, you will do a "streamlit run hub.py" to run the software. More on what packages to install in the final report.
	. Make sure to install every package missing on your computer such as:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Plotly
- Streamlit 
- Sklearn
- Glob
	To do that, you can do a "sudo pip install <Library name>"

- On the other hand, the report part:
	. You have the report in PDF
	. The Coding Updates Timeline, which is the updates and work I did as a software engineer through the year.
